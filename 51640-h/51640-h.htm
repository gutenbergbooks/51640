<p>Welcome to Natural Bridges
National Monument. We hope you
can take the time to enjoy a relaxed,
leisurely visit to the area and that this
Guide will help you to do so. If you
are like most visitors, you came here
specifically to see the three great
bridges. If that is all that you want to
do, you can get through the area in
less than two hours.</p>
<p>We suggest, however, that you plan
on spending more time here (if that&rsquo;s
possible in your situation). There are
more things here to see and do, and
more ways to look at the bridges, than
you may have realized. You have
invested time and money to get here
and you will gain a better return on
those investments if you can take a bit
more time to visit the Monument.</p>
<p>As you drive along the road, you
will occasionally find small parking
areas with numbered posts that look
like this:</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p002a.jpg" alt="Parking-area numbered post" width="400" height="316" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>The numbers on the posts refer to
numbered sections of this Guide, and
each section starts off something like
this:</p>
<h3 id="c2"><span class="mm1"><span>4</span></span> 1.7 (4.8) <b>Meander Viewpoint</b></h3>
<p>In the above example 4. is the
stop number; this is the fourth stop
on the trip, 1.7 is the distance (miles)
from the previous stop, (4.8) is the
mileage from the start of trip at the
Visitor Center, and <b>boldface words</b>
are the name of the stop.</p>
<p>Some sites are not described in the
Guide; there are parking places
without numbered posts. There are
scenic views or other points of interest
at these places, but we thought we&rsquo;d
leave some sites for you to &ldquo;do your
own thing,&rdquo; if you wish.</p>
<p>At any stop, numbered or not, you
must exercise care for your own and
your children&rsquo;s safety and you must be
reasonable in your use of the park.
There are many unfenced cliffs you
can fall off, rocks you can trip over,
and other natural hazards that could
injure or kill you. We will remind you
now and then about them, but we
can&rsquo;t protect you from every hazard.
You have to do your part, too. Being
reasonable in using the park involves
things like not throwing rocks off cliffs
(there may be someone below you),
not entering or climbing on prehistoric
ruins, not defacing things, and stuff
like that.</p>
<p>Actually, if you and the Monument
are both undamaged by your visit, we
should all be very pleased that you
chose to come here today.</p>
<p>Your visit to the bridges really
begins in the Visitor Center. If you
look over the exhibits, attend the slide
program, and ask the Information
Desk Ranger any questions you may
have, you will have begun to collect
data that should make the entire trip
more pleasant. Then, with the
preliminaries taken care of, step out
the <b>back</b> door and walk to your right.
From that point you and this guide are
on your own.</p>
<p class="tbcenter">HAVE A NICE DAY!</p>

<p class="pcap">Bears Ears</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c3">The Bears Ears.</h3>
<p>The two buttes
rising above Elk Ridge on the skyline
are called the Bears Ears. If you have
ever looked at a bear at all closely,
you may wonder why the buttes are
called Bears Ears. Well, we wonder
about that sometimes, too, for they
don&rsquo;t look at all like the ears of a bear.
&ldquo;Bears Ears&rdquo; is the officially approved
name, but that name was bestowed by
someone looking at the buttes from
another angle. Seen from one point of
view, physical features may appear
completely different than from another
point of view. Ideas are like that, too,
in many cases. If we can look at things
(including ideas) from a different point
of view, we may better understand
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>So, we have tried to arrange this
Guide in a way that allows you to
experiment with a few things that you
did not intend to do. The great
majority of visitors here drive in, look
at the three bridges and then drive
out. You can still do that, of course,
but this booklet suggests some
additional things which we hope will
add to your enjoyment of the
Monument.</p>
<p>The first stop along the road is 1.4
miles from here.</p>
<h3 id="c4"><span class="mm1"><span>2</span></span> 1.4 (1.4) <b>Sphinx Rock</b></h3>
<p>This is another of those different
point of view things. The guy who
named this was looking at it from
upper White Canyon. From that point
of view (the opposite of yours) the
resemblance to ancient Egyptian
figures make the name quite
reasonable, whereas from this side it
makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>The light-colored, nearly white rock
all over the place is Cedar Mesa
Sandstone, a relatively hard, fine-grained
rock. Scattered through it are
thin layers of dark red shale rock
which is much softer because it
contains a lot of muddy silt. The softer
red beds erode, or wear away, much
more quickly than the hard white
rock.</p>
<p>The long black or dark streaks on
the rocks are desert varnish, a
common occurrence here which we&rsquo;ll
explain at a <a href="#varnish">later stop</a>.</p>

<p>This is a nice place to
try a different point of view. You
came here to see the bridges, but at
this stop why not get out and look at
some other things of interest. You
have to be careful scrambling over the
rocks (the little arrow signs mark a
fairly good route) and when you get
out near the clifftop be <b>very</b> cautious,
but there&rsquo;s a beautiful view of the
canyon. You can also see cryptogamic
crust: a dark brown or black crusty
layer on the soil, it is actually a very
delicate plant community. DON&rsquo;T
WALK ON IT! Hop from rock to rock
or follow the little drainages of bare
sand. The cryptogamic soil is a combination
of algae, fungi, lichens, and
other odd plants, all dependent upon
each other for some factor necessary
to their lives.</p>

<p>You will see a lot of it in the
Monument; be careful not to damage
it. A single footstep can destroy 25,
50 or 100 years of growth.</p>
<p>Ravens are a frequent sight in the
canyon, flying or soaring along the
cliffs. Big and black, they are readily
recognized. More often, their throaty
croaking call is heard and that&rsquo;s easy
to recognize, too.</p>
<p>As you look along the canyon sides
(not down in the bottom), note the
trees on the slope and ledges&mdash;they&rsquo;re
different. Different from the
stocky pinyon and juniper on top and
different from the leafy green cottonwoods
in the bottom. The tall,
Christmas-tree-shaped evergreens are
douglasfir. See any on the other side
of the canyon? How about that? Why
do they grow on only one side of the
canyon?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>

<p>Lichens: Patches of color, bright or

Blue, black, orange, red, brown,
green, yellow and other colors. These
represent another odd plant
community. Lichens are a lot tougher
than the cryptogamic crust, but it
seems a shame to walk on them. They
are algae and fungi that live
intertwined lives. Neither can live
alone; each is utterly dependent upon
the other. Such things are called
&ldquo;symbiotic&rdquo; or &ldquo;symbiotes.&rdquo;
Incidentally, you&rsquo;re a symbiote, too, in
a way.</p>

<p class="pcap">Crossbedding</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crossbedding&rdquo; is all over the place,
and you can see it all through the
Monument in cliffs, exposed rock faces
of many kinds, boulders, etc. It is the
numerous groups of thin layers of rock
intersecting at odd angles. They are
the result of wind-blown sands drifting
across the landscape&mdash;a very different
landscape than that you see. The
Cedar Mesa Sandstone is largely made
up of sands that drifted here in great
dunes. The loose grains were later
covered by more sediments, cemented
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
together by other minerals, and are
now being uncovered and worn away
by erosion. With each step, you free
grains of sand that have been locked
in place for about 180 million years.
Those grains will now move on,
eventually to come to rest and again
become frozen in time. Rub the
sandstone with your hand and feel the
sand grains break loose.</p>
<p>There is an Indian ruin across the
canyon. Can you see it?</p>
<p>The douglasfir community grows on
the more shaded side of the canyon,
for it cannot tolerate the hotter and
drier environments on the sunny side
or on the mesa top. In fact, the tops
of most douglasfir growing near the
cliff rise only to the level of the cliff
top. Many have dead tops even with
the cliffs edge. Hot dry winds from
the mesa <b>apparently</b> kill the tops of
these mountain forest trees, but we&rsquo;re
not really sure that&rsquo;s the reason for the
dead tops. Can you think of a better
one?</p>

<p>Natural bridges are often
described in terms like young, mature,
and old, but the words have nothing
to do with age in years. A &ldquo;young&rdquo;
bridge has a great, massive span
above a relatively small hole. An &ldquo;old&rdquo;
bridge has a very thin span over a
relatively large opening. A &ldquo;mature&rdquo;
bridge is intermediate between young
and old. The same terms can be used
to describe natural arches&mdash;which form
in a very different manner than do
bridges. Remember, the terms reflect
stages of development, not age in
years (a mature bridge could be older
in years than an old bridge!). Sipapu is
mature.</p>

<p>You came here to see bridges
and you got a good view of one at the
last stop. Here is an outstanding
opportunity for another, but different,
view of that bridge. Two different
views, in fact.</p>
<p>A trail starts here, proceeds about
halfway down into the canyon and out
along a ledge to an outstanding view
of this beautiful, graceful bridge. It&rsquo;s a
fairly easy walk with guard rails, metal
stairs, and other aids. You have to
climb one short ladder. You can see
an ancient Indian ruin, may learn
quite a bit about the douglasfir
community, and will get an excellent
chance to photograph the bridge. You
can walk out and back in about half
an hour, but you may find that you
want to take longer.</p>
<p>About halfway to the viewpoint,
another trail takes off and goes right
down into the canyon. DO NOT take
that route unless you&rsquo;re prepared for a
much more ambitious hike. You need
good footwear (like boots with a good
sole for rock), drinking water in warm
or hot weather, and plenty of time
(allow 2-3 hours at least). It&rsquo;s a nice
trip and you&rsquo;ll never really appreciate
how huge this bridge is unless you
stand under it, but we do not
recommend the hike unless you are
physically fit and properly prepared.</p>
<p>SPECIAL WARNING: When you
make a trip into <b>any</b> canyon in this
part of the country, beware of flash
floods. Even if the weather is fine
where <b>you</b> are, be on the lookout for
thunderstorms or heavy rain upstream
from your location. If it&rsquo;s raining
upstream, or if great towering clouds
are building up, STAY OUT OF THE
STREAMBED in the bottom of the
canyon. NEVER CAMP in or next to
a streambed in this region, even if it is
dry. If you get caught by a healthy
flash flood, you&rsquo;re dead.</p>
<p>The following lettered paragraphs
are coordinated with numbered stakes
along the trail to the viewpoint. They
help explain features as you see them.
If you are not taking advantage of the
different points of view here, turn to
<a href="#Page_16">page 16</a>. (It&rsquo;s OK to read the trail
guide even if you don&rsquo;t take the walk.)</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>6<br />A</span></span>
How&rsquo;s this for a different point of
view? It used to be, when people
wanted to do what you are doing, that
they scrambled out on the rocks,
crawled across these logs and climbed
down the tree. That was the <b>only</b> way
down the cliff. Now you gain access
via the stairs, which cost a few
thousand of your tax dollars. <b>Your</b>
dollars, remember, not just
&ldquo;Government funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, some folks say we ruined the
trip, that it&rsquo;s no fun anymore. Others
say we should have built wooden
stairs, not metal. Some think this is
fine and a few want nothing less than
an elevator or tram. What do you
think?</p>
<p>How does the difficulty of getting to
a place affect your feeling for that
place? How does it affect your opinion

<p class="pcap">White Throated Swifts</p>
</div>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>6<br />B</span></span>
A thousand years ago this
summer, a man stood where you
now stand and he watched the white
throated swifts sweep in and out of
cracks in the cliff above you. He didn&rsquo;t
know they were white throated swifts
nor did he care. His main interest was
to see if any baby birds had fallen
from their nests into the pile of
manure. Many do, each year, and the
occupants of this land used any food
they could find.</p>
<p>In that 1,000 years, nearly a
thousand generations of swifts have
come and gone. Each year they
return, nest in the cracks, wing their
way through the canyons catching
insects, and produce a new generation
from the stuff of their environment. A
thousand generations have passed; the
swifts are still here. There are neither
more nor less than the previous owner
of the land watched a thousand years
ago, and a thousand generations have
left the environment ready for a
thousand more. What of us&mdash;of Man?</p>
<p>Less than 50 generations of man
have passed since the day your
predecessor watched the birds from
this point. Our numbers have
increased to many times the number
there were then and each of us uses
many times as much from our
environment.</p>
<p>Today we endure shortages of food,
services and materials. Twenty-five
years from now there will be twice as
many of us. What will become of us?
In fact, come to think of it, what
became of the guy who watched the
birds 1,000 years ago?</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>6<br />C</span></span>
A few minutes ago we wrote of a
previous owner of this land who
gathered dead birds. Well, this is his
house. It may not look like much now
(and probably didn&rsquo;t look an awful lot
better then), but it has become a little
rundown after 1,000 (800, or
whatever) years. He may have been
quite proud of it (it&rsquo;s bigger than most)
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
and he built it all himself. No planes,
trains, barges, boats, trucks, or even
wheelbarrows. In fact, no wheels! A
family of Anasazis could have anything
they wanted, just so long as they
could get it by themselves.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

</div>
<p>Please do not enter the ruin. In
doing so, you can easily and
innocently damage it. What we call
&ldquo;innocent vandalism&rdquo; probably results
in more irreparable damage than is
caused by deliberate vandals.</p>
<p>The Anasazis probably did a little
farming down in the canyon, growing
and storing some corn, beans and
squash. They gathered wild fruits and
seeds and made fiber from native
plants. They apparently led a difficult
life, and probably ate anything they
could get: lizards, snakes, birds, mice,
squirrels, rabbits, and rarely a deer or
bighorn sheep. Some scientists say
they also ate each other, but we don&rsquo;t
know if this is true.</p>
<p>But the Anasazi lived within certain
environmental limitations, just as we
do. They needed food, water, fuel,
and other resources, just as we do.</p>
<p>There came a time, about 700 years
ago, when the environment here
changed just a little. Annual rainfall
patterns changed, there was a serious
drought, and other factors may have
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
contributed. Whatever the reasons, the
Anasazi world changed and Man could
no longer survive here. Man, ancient
or modern, can adapt to a certain
range of environmental change. There
are limits to adaptability, though, and
if the changes exceed those limits,
Man must move to a more suitable
place or die. The Anasazi moved.</p>
<p>Your environment is changing very
rapidly and the changes are world
wide. Where will you move to?</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>6<br />D</span></span>
Here it is, Sipapu. In Hopi Indian
legend, the Sipapu is a passage
between two very different worlds.
Some visitors see a similarity here.
Beneath your feet and all around you
is a world of slickrock: nearly barren
expanses of sandstone. But through
the Sipapu you can see a world of
vegetation: a softer, less harsh, more
pleasant world. One can almost
imagine that the Sipapu is a gateway
to another world.</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s an opportunity to adopt
a truly different point of view: as
different as it could be. We&rsquo;d like you
to be an Indian. Even if you already
are an Indian, this walk will offer a

<p>The trail is easy and has few
hazards. Of course, you <b>always</b> have
to exercise reasonable caution on trails
or in any unfamiliar environment, but
the main thing to beware of on this

and you and the kids have to be
careful around them.</p>
<p>If you take the trail, try to put
yourself in the place of a man of 800

Na&rsquo;va produces tangy, tart fruits
in good seasons. I like it; it&rsquo;s one
of the few really tasty things in my

don&rsquo;t like it very much.</p>

Mo&rsquo;hu is a good plant. We eat
the seed pods, which usually
have tasty grubs in them. My woman
braids or twists the leaf fibers and
makes the nets, cords, and other
things a man needs. Mo&rsquo;vi, the bottom
of the plant, helps make me clean

<p><span class="mm2"><span>7<br />C</span></span>
Ersvi in hot water makes a drink I

Na&rsquo;shu is a really good tree, for
you can use it for many things.
The timber is good building material,
and the big seeds are good to eat
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
when the cones ripen and open.
Some years there are many of them,
and then the women need not work

<p><span class="mm2"><span>7<br />E</span></span>
Ho&rsquo;taki is another very good tree,

Almost always, I can find lizards
in places like this. Even in winter,

There is our home! When I&rsquo;m
hunting up here, I like to look
down at our village. It is a good place
to live. The sun shines under the cliff
in winter, warming the whole village,
but the cliff shades our houses in
summer.</p>
<p>The fields along the canyon floor
have good crops most years, and our
storage bins are usually full at the end
of summer.</p>
<p>Well, I must leave you now, for I
have much to do before dark. Good
hunting!</p>
<p>You have come out here trying to
see the world from the Anasazi point
of view, we hope, but as you return
you may wish to consider a 20th
century point of view.</p>
<p>The 800-year-old buildings across
the canyon and 500 feet below are
called Horse Collar Ruin. It is a village
of several homes, two kivas
(ceremonial and religious building used
by men only), and numerous storage
bins. It may have been home for
about 30 people. The brush covered
flats along the stream were probably
farmed, producing corn, beans, and
other storable crops. Many other food
sources were used; native plants and
animals were eaten and provided
numerous necessary &ldquo;side products.&rdquo;
Hides, bone, horn, feather, bark,
wood, etc., were the raw materials for
many tools, implements and supplies.</p>
<p>Anasazi villages were often located
so as to be bathed in winter sunshine
and shaded in summer. A somewhat
more technological use of the sun&rsquo;s
energy provides most of the electricity
used in the Monument today.</p>

<p><span class="mm2"><span>7<br />H</span></span>
You may see lizards just about
anywhere in the park. The more
common varieties in slickrock areas
like this are <b><i>whiptails</i></b> (very sleek,
streamlined; tail much longer than
body), <b><i>eastern fence lizard</i></b> (rough;
spiny; blue patches on throat and
belly), <b><i>side-blotched lizard</i></b> (long tail;
spiny; blue patch behind front legs).</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>7<br />G</span></span>
Potholes, or rock pools, are a
common feature of flat sandstone
beds. Some reach great size and depth
and not all the steps in their development
are understood. Once a slight
depression is formed by erosion, it
holds water for a while after each rain.
The moisture dissolves some cement
and encourages more rapid erosion,
thus deepening the depression. The
depression thus holds water longer,
and so grows faster. Wind may sweep
away the loosened sand grains when
the pothole is dry.</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>7<br />F</span></span>
Lichens are a &ldquo;symbiotic&rdquo; plant
association, as you may
remember. An alga and fungus grow
together, each providing to the other
an element necessary to life. Neither
can live alone; each is dependent
upon the other.</p>
<p>Lichens are rather effective agents
of erosion, which seems a bit surprising
for a thin crust on the rocks,
but it&rsquo;s true. Like most plants, lichens
tend to make the immediate area
more acid. The &ldquo;cement&rdquo; that holds
sand grains together to make sandstone
here is very susceptible to acid.
The lichens create acid conditions, the
acid dissolves the cement, and the
sand grains are freed to blow or wash
away. And <b>that</b> is what &ldquo;erosion&rdquo; is all
about.</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>7<br />E</span></span>
Juniper [<b>Juniperus
osteosperma</b>]. Various species of
juniper are common in the arid
southwest. As you climb from desert
grasslands to higher elevations, the
junipers are usually the first trees you
see. With pinyon pine, they often
form a dense &ldquo;pigmy forest&rdquo; of short,
burly trees. At slightly higher elevations,
where it is a little cooler and
moister, ponderosa pine and other
trees replace the pinyon-juniper. The
tiny scale-like needles on the twigs,
and abundant bluish berries make
junipers easy to identify.</p>

Pinyon <b>[Pinus edulis]</b>. Usually
found growing with junipers in the
pinyon-juniper woodland or pygmy
forest. Under ideal conditions, pinyon
may grow into quite respectable trees!
The seeds are still used as a staple diet
item by Southwestern Indians. As
pinyon &ldquo;nuts,&rdquo; they also find their way
into gourmet and specialty food shops.
The inconspicuous flowers appear in

Mormon tea [<b>Ephedra viridis</b>].
Used by Indians and pioneers as
a stimulant and medicine, the
beverage is still used as a spring tonic
by many.</p>
<p>Ephedra is really kind of a neat
plant. Like most desert plants, it has
evolved methods of conserving water.
For one thing, it has no leaves. Look
at it closely&mdash;it&rsquo;s all stem. Plants can
lose a lot of water from their leaves
and many desert plants have leaves
modified to reduce water loss, but
Mormon tea has dispensed with leaves
entirely (Well, almost entirely: they get
very tiny ones in the spring, which
soon fall off). Plants usually need
green leaves to produce food, but
Ephedra has many green stems that
carry out that function.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>7<br />B</span></span>
Yucca [<b>Yucca brevifolia</b>]. The
yuccas are very common
throughout the Southwest, from low
desert to mountains. There are many
species, but they share one great
peculiarity. They are symbiotic with a
little white moth, the Pronuba.</p>
<p>Female Pronubas live in the
blossoms. After mating, the moth
collects a ball of yucca pollen and jams
it onto the stigma (female part) of the
flower. Yucca pollen is heavy and
sticky; it doesn&rsquo;t float around in the
wind. Other insects do not transport it.
The Pronuba insures that the plant will
produce seeds by fertilizing the
blossom and then she lays eggs in the
base of the flower where the seeds will
grow. The larvae that hatch from her
eggs eat many seeds, but a lot of the
seeds mature, too. The moth will not
lay her eggs anywhere else.</p>
<p>The Pronuba <b>must</b> have yuccas to
reproduce. The yuccas <b>must</b> have
Pronubas to reproduce. Neither can
get along without the other.</p>

Prickly pear cactus [<b>Opuntia</b>].
Like all desert cactus, these are
well adapted to the arid environment.
Like Ephedra, cactus are all stem,
have no leaves, and the stems (or
&ldquo;pads&rdquo;) contain green chlorophyll, the
critically important element in food
production. Cactus spines are
modified leaves that serve as effective
protection, but are not functional food
producers. When moisture is
abundant, cactus pads get plump and
smooth. During extended dry spells,
the pads shrink and wrinkle as the
plant uses the stored water. How has
the weather been around here
recently? Look at the cactus and you
can tell!</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t get a very
good view of Kachina Bridge
here, but you will find it much easier
to understand how bridges are formed
if you walk out to the canyon rim.
There is no trail, but it&rsquo;s an easy walk
without unusual hazards other than
the ever present cliffs. Remember,
DON&rsquo;T WALK ON THE CRYPTOGAMIC
CRUST!</p>

<p class="pcap">Desert Varnish</p>
</div>
<p><a id="varnish">Desert</a> varnish, the dark streaks on
the canyon walls, is common in arid
areas such as this. Each time the rock
gets wet, some moisture is absorbed
by the rock. Water actually seeps into
tiny spaces between the grains of
sand. Later, the moisture is drawn out
of the rock and evaporated by hot,
dry air. While inside the sandstone,
however, the water dissolves minute
amounts of minerals like iron and
manganese. When the water comes to
the rock surface and evaporates, the
minerals come with it&mdash;but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
minerals do not evaporate. They
accumulate on the surface of the rock
over thousands of years, slowly forming
a very thin dark crust.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p015a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="434" />
<p class="pcap">White Canyon</p>
</div>
<p>Notice the long, curving, fairly level
valley right below you. This is an
important part of the bridge formation
story, for that valley was the stream
channel before Kachina Bridge was
formed. The stream now flows
through the hole under the bridge, of
course, but before there was a hole
the water had to run around this side
of the mass of rock that now forms the
bridge. Every time White Canyon
flooded (which is every time it rained
very much), the stream cut a little
deeper into the base of the rock and
most of the cutting took place right
where the stream was forced to turn
toward you. As flood waters roared
around this curving valley, the shape
of the canyon also threw them against
the downstream side of the obstructing
wall of rock, so that the stream was
eating into both sides of a fairly thin
wall. It eventually ate right through the
obstruction, and from then on the
stream followed the shorter, straighter
route. Continued erosion enlarged the
opening and cut the channel deeper
into the canyon. Downcutting of the
new channel left this old channel high
and dry. And there it sits!</p>
<p>Actually, the water coming down
Armstrong Canyon (on the left) also
contributed to bridge development, but
we&rsquo;ll get into that at a <a href="#armstrong">later stop</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c11"><span class="mm1"><span>9</span></span> 0.3 (5.1) <b>Kachina Bridge, viewpoint and trailhead</b></h3>
<p>Kachina is an excellent example of a
young bridge. The thick, heavy span
crosses a relatively small opening. The
span and abutments are massive, not
slim and graceful.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p016a.jpg" alt="" width="519" height="463" />
<p class="pcap">Pictographs</p>
</div>
<p>Below the bridge are ancient
pictographs (drawings on stone) that
some people felt represented or at
least looked like the Hopi Indian gods
called Kachinas. So the original name
was discarded and &ldquo;Kachina&rdquo; was
substituted.</p>
<p>As at the other bridges, there is a
very nice little trail down into the
canyon. The trail is in good condition,
you can walk it without special
equipment, and it isn&rsquo;t especially
strenuous. It is a bit steep, so coming
back on a hot day you may find the
trip can be tedious. If the weather is
fairly warm or hot today, you may
also want to take water. An hour or
hour and a half is adequate time to
allow for the trip&mdash;unless you fool
around a lot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>9<br />A</span></span>
The Monument landscape is
typified by hundreds of ledges and
shelves separating the cliffs. Nearly all
the canyon walls are lined with such
ledges. That is because the rather hard
Cedar Mesa sandstone is seamed with
many thin layers of relatively soft rock.
The softer material erodes very much
faster, and as it wears away, the rock
above and below it is also exposed to
the elements. As a deep horizontal
crevice develops, support for the rock
above it is removed and chunks
eventually fall out. In time, a wide
ledge (or shelf, or bench, or whatever)
forms.</p>
<p>All of the above is happening here,
right in front of you. This <b>isn&rsquo;t</b> just an
interesting formation, it&rsquo;s a dynamic,
continuing process that is changing the
landscape.</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>9<br />B</span></span>
The canyon coming around the
corner on your left is Armstrong
Canyon. It joins White Canyon on
your right. In front of you is a waterfall
(or it would be there if any water was
flowing) above a deep, narrow plunge
pool. This type of thing is often called
a &ldquo;nick point,&rdquo; and it is evidence of
some abrupt change in the canyon&rsquo;s
development. In this case, that change
was probably formation of Kachina
Bridge, which changed the gradient,
or steepness, of the stream. The
water, rushing over the lip and
plunging into the pool, quarries out a
hollow under the lip. In time the lip
breaks off, the waterfall moves back a
few feet, and the process goes on. A
similar, but somewhat larger nick point
is Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>If the canyon is dry today, it may be
a little difficult to believe the
explanation. If you could be here just
after a heavy rain, when the flood
thunders over the rocks at a rate of
thousands of gallons <b>each second</b>,
you would find the whole thing more
believable.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>9<br />C</span></span>
This little arch (it&rsquo;s <b>not</b> a bridge)
may not win prizes for size, but it is
very handy for helping explain bridge
or arch growth. A bridge is first
formed by the action of running water,
but much of its subsequent growth is
like development of an arch. Water
seeps into tiny cracks, freezes in
winter, and pries flakes or blocks of
stone loose. Alternate heat and cold
causes rock to expand and contract
and that opens little cracks, causes
tension, etc. If the rock has natural
planes in it, it may break away along
those lines.</p>
<p>If you look at the underside and
sides of this little arch, you can see
evidence of these processes. <b>Please</b>
don&rsquo;t &ldquo;help nature along&rdquo; by prying
pieces loose.</p>
<p>This arch may not have been here
very many centuries, but it is a very
&ldquo;old&rdquo; arch. Thin and delicate, the
fragile span over a relatively huge
opening is near the end of its life.</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>9<br />D</span></span>
Back when we explained bridge
formation and abandoned
meanders, we said Armstrong
Canyon&rsquo;s run-off played an important
role in Kachina&rsquo;s development and
that we would explain it &ldquo;later.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="armstrong">Well,</a> now is later. Before the
opening was formed, while White
Canyon run-off came around the
channel on your right, Armstrong
Canyon run-off flowed down the
channel from your left and rushed
right against the rock wall that once
existed where the opening now is.
Flood waters roaring down Armstrong
would rush out its mouth, cross the
White Canyon streambed, and smash
into that rock wall. Floods carry great
loads of sediment: sand, gravel,
pebbles, rocks and boulders. These
are the teeth of a flood, the sand and
boulders. They are the agents of
erosion that bang, smash and batter
any obstruction. It is a bit like a liquid
saw with stone teeth. It&rsquo;s an act of
violence, a cataclysm, a ripping and
tearing. There really isn&rsquo;t anything nice
or gentle about it, but it&rsquo;s a great way
to undercut rock walls and gnaw holes
in them!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>And that is precisely what it did.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s about enough for a
while. You are more than halfway
through the Monument and we&rsquo;ve
been telling you what to see, do, and
think entirely long enough. Go now,
and just enjoy the rest of this lovely
walk. Walk the trail in leisure and
peace. At the bridge are ancient ruins
and irreplaceable prehistoric rock art.
Let them speak to you, respect them,
and consider your long gone
predecessors here. Consider your
place here, too, and the role you play
in our beautiful little world.</p>
<p>BEWARE! And go cautiously, for
there are spirits here that will make
you part of this land and forever call
you back!</p>

<h3 id="c12"><span class="mm1"><span>10</span></span> 2.0 (7.1) <b>Owachomo Bridge viewpoint and trailhead</b></h3>
<p>Owachomo is a lovely bridge. Long,
thin, flat; a fragile old bridge nearing
its logical and inevitable end: collapse.
The opening grows very slowly under
an old bridge. The opening widens as
the bridge abutments wear away and
the overhead span (the bridge itself)
becomes thinner and thinner, one
grain of sand at a time.</p>
<p>The walk down to this bridge is the
easiest of all. You can be down and
back in a half hour (as usual, we
recommend that you take longer). It is
not strenuous, compared with the
other two, and it offers some nice
insights about bridges. In other words,
here&rsquo;s another different point of view.
Owachomo is sort of a different kind
of natural bridge, for it was formed
differently than the others. We&rsquo;ll
explain <b>that</b> when you get down
there.</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>10<br />A</span></span>
We haven&rsquo;t said very much about
wildlife here, mostly because you
aren&rsquo;t likely to see much of it. Here
however, you can see the work of a
porcupine. Porcupines like to eat
pinyon bark at times, and this pinyon
must be pretty tasty. The large rodents
gnaw at the tree to get at the
nutritious inner bark, and may in time
kill the tree by girdling it. The inner
bark carries needed food and water
between roots and leaves (both up
and down), and if all the lifelines
between the top and bottom of the
tree are severed, the top will die.</p>
<p>No, we don&rsquo;t try to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; the
tree from porcupines. We call this a
natural area, and that means it is an
area where we try to let natural events
proceed without the interference of
man. That isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;protection&rdquo; of
things, it&rsquo;s protection of a system. It
just means that if the porcupine wants
to eat the pinyon, let him do it. It
doesn&rsquo;t mean the porcupine is &ldquo;worth&rdquo;
more than the pine, nor vice versa.
Each has its own place, its own life,
and its own interactions with the rest
of the world. Just like you do!</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>10<br />B</span></span>
This is a good place to consider
Owachomo&rsquo;s origin and
evolution.</p>
<p>Run-off from a large area used to
flow down the little canyon (Tuwa
Canyon) in front of you, along the
base of a rock fin, and into Armstrong
Canyon behind you to your right.
Owachomo did not exist; there was no
natural bridge at that time. Flood
waters rushing down this side of the
fin ate into the base of the fin and
flood waters of Armstrong Canyon ate
into the other side. A hole developed
in the fin, creating the bridge and
allowing Tuwa&rsquo;s run-off a shorter route
to Armstrong.</p>
<p>So, Owachomo was formed by the
action of two separate streams, and
that makes it different from Kachina
and Sipapu (and most other natural
bridges we know about).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p020.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="507" />
<p class="pcap">Owachomo Bridge</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Erosion is a continuing, dynamic
process; however, stream channels
gradually change. The run-off from
Tuwa no longer flows through the little
canyon in front of you because there
is now a deeper canyon on the other
side of the bridge fin.</p>
<p><span class="mm2"><span>10<br />C</span></span>
Passing the &ldquo;Unmaintained Trail&rdquo;
sign isn&rsquo;t like abandoning all
hope, but it does mean that the trail
may be harder to follow and that we
don&rsquo;t do as much to protect or help
you. Some hikers continue from here
and go all the way back to Sipapu via
the canyon&rsquo;s trail. Many people start at
Sipapu and come out this way (which
is a lot easier), but a few start here
and go back. It isn&rsquo;t really a terribly
difficult hike, either way, and it is a lot
of fun.</p>
<p>Owachomo must once have looked
like Kachina&mdash;massive, solid, strong.
Later, it was more like Sipapu&mdash;graceful
and well balanced. Now it
looks only like itself and the even
more fragile Landscape Arch in
Arches National Park.</p>
<p>At some time soon, one more grain
will fall, a crack will race through the
stone, and the bridge will be a heap of
rubble in the canyon. We&rsquo;ll probably
run around and yell a lot when it
happens, while the sand grains will
quietly continue to break free and
begin the next phase of their
existence.</p>
<p>If you decide to walk on under the
bridge, look behind the left abutment.
There, a thin bed of the softer red
stone has eroded back under the
harder stuff of which the bridge is
made. As erosion eats into the red-bed,
removing support from the
abutment, the future of the bridge
becomes less and less secure. Frankly,
we always feel a little nervous standing
under it (where you are now) because
it might collapse ... now!</p>
<p>As you return to your car, be aware
that you may hear the death roar of
Owachomo. The final, critical grain of
sand may slip out of place, a bird may
land on the bridge, or one of your
military jets may pass at supersonic
speed. However it happens,
Owachomo must someday fall. And its
billions of sand grains must continue
their journey to another resting place,
and that&rsquo;s the way it ought to be.</p>

<h3 id="c13"><span class="mm1"><span>11</span></span> 1.4 (8.5) <b>Maverick Point View</b></h3>
<p>To your right, across what
appears as a fairly level stretch of
pinyon-juniper forest, the Cedar Mesa
sandstone is cut, slashed, incised, and
divided by a bewildering complex of
canyons. Slightly to the left of the
&ldquo;flats,&rdquo; Maverick Point, Bears Ears,
and long Elk Ridge (named by and for
three cowboys with the initials E, L,
and K, if you&rsquo;d like another point of
view!) form the skyline. Bears Ears, by
the way, was named by Spanish
explorers far to the south, from which
point they look just like a bear peeking
over the ridge.</p>
<h3 id="c14"><span class="mm1"><span>12</span></span> 0.6 (9.1) <b>Sunset Point</b></h3>
<p>If sunset is imminent, stay right
here. Sunsets are sometimes very
spectacular here.</p>
<p>Now go, and travel in peace,
comfort and safety. Come again when
the Canyon Country calls, if you can,
but remember always that it remains
here waiting, free, beautiful and
untamed.</p>
<p>If you have questions about this
magnificent land, stop at the Visitor
Center. The men and women of the
National Park Service will be greatly
pleased to talk with you of this and
the 300 other areas they serve for you
and your children. And their children.

but it really does work. The system

This process is liable to become very
widely used within a decade, so the

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
